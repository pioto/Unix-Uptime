Unix-Uptime is Copyright (C) 2008-2012, Mike Kelly.

This is a simple module that allows you to get the current system
uptime, in seconds, and the current load average.

On *BSD systems, this involves using an optional XS module, with a
fallback on parsing the output of the 'syslog' command. If you wish to
avoid building the XS module, set the 'NO_XS' environment variable to
some true value before running `perl Build.PL`.

See the Unix::Uptime perldoc for more information.
